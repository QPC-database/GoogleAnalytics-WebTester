	h2#about About this site

	p <strong>Google Analytics Web Tester</strong> is a tool to help developers, digital analysts and QAs validate the implementation of Google Analytics tracking on a website.

	p For a complete overview of how to set up the library, head out to <a href="how-does-it-work.html" title="How Google Analytics Web Tester works"><em>How does it work?</em></a>.

	p The code for this entire site is open source and <a href="https://github.com/philsawicki/GoogleAnalytics-WebTester"> available on GitHub</a>. I encourage you to take a look if you'd like to see how anything is done.



	h3 Motivation

	p Testing proper implementation of Google Analytics Tracking on a website can be a tricky thing to do. Unless you run a daily gamut of tests, what works one day may be broken the next one without you ever noticing.

	p But it doesn't have to be that way.

	p This library eases the process of writing automated tests by providing a set of easy to use utility methods. It comes with an AngularJS demo application to show how to validate that the <code>ga()</code> snippet receives the expected data when the user interacts with the page.

	p Whether using the Google Analytics snippet directly (<code>ga()</code>) or Google Tag Manager, all tracking interactions can be recorded the exact same way:
		ul
			li Pageviews
			li Custom Events
			li Custom Metrics / Dimensions
			li Enhanced E-Commerce
			li Social Interactions
			li Timings
			li Exception Tracking
			li etc.

	p Just set the URL of your website, write a couple of specs and run the app, or set it to run after each build/deployment.
