	h2.sub-header#about About this site

	p <strong>Google Analytics Web Tester</strong> is a tool to help developers, digital analysts and QAs validate the implementation of Google Analytics tracking on a website.

	p For a complete overview of how to set up the library, head out to <a href="how-does-it-work.html" title="How Google Analytics Web Tester works"><em>How does it work?</em></a>.

	p The code for this entire site is open source and <a href="https://github.com/philsawicki/GoogleAnalytics-WebTester"> available on GitHub</a>. I encourage you to take a look if you'd like to see how anything is done.


	h2.sub-header Demo

	p This is what a successfully ran test suite looks like:

	div.row#screenshotsSlideshow
		div(class="col-sm-6 col-md-5")
			img#protractorScreenshot(src="images/screenshots/Google Analytics Web Tester - Protractor Screenshot 00.png", alt="Google Analytics Web Tester Browser Preview", title="Google Analytics Web Tester Browser Preview")
		div(class="col-sm-6 col-md-7")
			img#consoleScreenshot(src="images/screenshots/Google Analytics Web Tester - Console Screenshot 00.png", alt="Google Analytics Web Tester Console", title="Google Analytics Web Tester Console")



	h3 Motivation

	p Testing proper implementation of Google Analytics Tracking on a website can be a tricky thing to do. Unless you run a daily gamut of tests, what works one day may be broken the next one without you ever noticing.

	p But it doesn't have to be that way.

	p This library eases the process of writing automated tests by providing a set of easy to use utility methods. It comes with an AngularJS demo application to show how to validate that the <code>ga()</code> snippet receives the expected data when the user interacts with the page.

	p Whether using the Google Analytics snippet directly (<code>ga()</code>) or Google Tag Manager, all tracking interactions can be recorded the exact same way:
	ul
		li: a(href="examples-pageviews.html", title="Pageviews Code Samples") Pageviews
		li: a(href="examples-events.html", title="Events Code Samples") Custom Events
		li: a(href="examples-custom-metrics.html", title="Custom Metrics Code Samples") Custom Metrics
		li: a(href="examples-custom-dimensions.html", title="Custom Dimensions Code Samples") Custom Dimensions
		li: a(href="examples-enhanced-ecommerce.html", title="Enhanced E-Commerce Code Samples") Enhanced E-Commerce
		li: a(href="examples-content-grouping.html", title="Content Grouping Code Samples") Content Grouping
		li: a(href="examples-social-interactions.html", title="Social Interactions Code Samples") Social Interactions
		li: a(href="examples-user-timings.html", title-"User Timings Code Samples") User Timings
		li: a(href="examples-cross-device-tracking.html", title="Cross-Device Tracking") Cross-Device Tracking
		li: a(href="examples-exception-tracking.html", title="Exception Tracking") Exception Tracking

	p Just set the URL of your website, write a couple of specs and run the app, or set it to run after each build/deployment.
